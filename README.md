# Name_Game_Gender_Prediction_using_Sound
It is a project provided by DATACAMP. In this project, I used the Python package Fuzzy to find out the genders of authors that have appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture books.
First, using fuzzy (sound) name matching, I searched for author names in a dataset provided by the US Social Security Administration that contains names and genders of all individuals who have applied for Social Security Cards. Next, I aggregated the author dataset by including gender. Finally, I used the new dataset to plot the gender distribution of children's picture books authors over time.
I also use python's different package modules like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.
